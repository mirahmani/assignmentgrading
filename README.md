Organize student assignment files.

How it works:
1. Go to base directory where you will put your assignment files on
2. Take assignment number as user input. e.g. 1a,1b,2,3a, etc. and store it as string 'Assignment<assignment#>' (e.g. Assignment1a)
3. If folder already exist, automatically organize file under 'submission.zip' (assuming the submission.zip already exist). If not exist yet, create folder with name 'Assignment<assignment#>', and create child folder 'done' and 'solution'

This script is currently made to tailor my need.
Feel free to modify, to suit your need.
It is made for OSX, but should also work for Windows/Linux. Just change the directory format.
